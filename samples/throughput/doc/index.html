	<h1><center>Throughput Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>
		This example analizes how the application level throughput changes in the function of the nominal bitrate in a 802.11a network.
	</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>Application level throughput</b></p>

	<p>
		802.11 modes are denoted by the nominal data bitrate (e.g. 54 Mbps). However, the bitrate available for an application
		is less because of various protocol overheads, like preamble, physical and mac headers. In this model, the actual application level throughput is measured.
	</p>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>
		The network contains two <tt>wirelessHosts</tt>, with a distance of 1 meter. The <i>sourceHost</i> sends a UDP stream of 1000 byte packets
		to <i>destinationHost</i> in ad-hoc mode. The UDP application in <i>sourceHost</i> is configured to saturate the channel when it is transmitting
		with the fastest bitrate. There are no lost packets, because the hosts are close to each other. The path loss model is free space
		path loss.
	</p>

	<p>
		The parameter study iterates all 802.11 mode a bitrates (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 Mbps). Each simulation
		runs for 1 second, and the throughput is averaged for this interval.
	</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>

	<p>
		The results are compared to theoretical computed values for the throughput. The frame exchange duration can be calculated from the
		nominal bitrate and the payload size. For example, the excel sheet 
		<a href="https://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/Packet_transmission_time_in_802.11" target="_blank">here</a> can be used for this purpose. It takes the data frame, the
		ack frame, and the interframe gap between them into account. By assuming an average back off time that is half of the minimal contention window, the theoretical throughput can
		be calculated.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following chart compares the computed throughput with the results of the simulation, at all bitrates.
