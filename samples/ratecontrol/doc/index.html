	<h1><center>Rate Control Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>This example demonstrates INET's 802.11 rate control mechanism. Two hosts are moving around on the
		playground, while one of them is sending a wireless UDP stream to the other. Sometimes the transmission
		is partially blocked by an obstacle, causing packet loss. Scenarios demonstrate how this affects the
		UDP stream when the hosts use rate control and when they don't.</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>About rate control</b></p>

	<p>The physical layers of IEEE 802.11 devices are capable of transmitting at several different rates. The different rates can use different channel access methods, like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or directs sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and different modulation schemes like binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or
		different types of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Each of these have different tolerances of effects like fading, attenuation and interference from other radio sources. In varying channel conditions,
		using the fastest rate might not be optimal for performance. Rate control algorithms adapt the transmission
		rate dynamically to the changing channel conditions, so the performance of the radio link can be maximized.
		EXAMPLE
	</p>

	<p><b>Rate control algorithms</b></p>

	<p>Rate control alogithms vary the transmission rate according to packet loss. When too many packets are lost (ie. the ACK for them doesn't arrive) the transmission rate is lowered. When a number of packets are sent without loss, the rate is increased.
	</p>

	<p>INET has different rate control algoritm models, like <tt>ARFRateControl</tt>, <tt>AARFRateControl</tt> and
		<tt>OnoeRateControl</tt>.
	</p>

	<p><b>The network</b></p>

	<p>Hosts are placed on the edge of the playground. During the simulation, they move along the edge of the
		playground with different speed, while <i>Host[0]</i> sends UDP packets to <i>sinkHost</i>. There is an
		obstacle in the middle of the playground. The line of
		transmission intersects the obstacle at certain times, which degrades transmissions.
	</p>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>
		The two hosts are configured to move along the edges of the playground at different speeds, so the distance
		between them varies. Host[0] is configured saturate the channel with UDP traffic when using the fastest
		mode, 54 mbps. This way the maximum throughput can be measured.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two configurations. In one of them, hosts use no rate control mechanism, and in the other they use
		 Adaptive Auto Rate Fallback (AARF). Results for the two simulation runs can be compared, and see how the
		 use of rate control affects throughput.
