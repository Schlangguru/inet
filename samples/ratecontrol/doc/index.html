	<h1><center>Rate Control Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>This example demonstrates INET's 802.11 rate control mechanism. Two hosts are moving around on the
		playground, while one of them is sending a wireless UDP stream to the other. Sometimes the transmission
		is partially blocked by an obstacle, causing packet loss. Scenarios demonstrate how this affects the
		throughput when the hosts use rate control and when they don't.</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>About rate control</b></p>

	<p>The physical layers of IEEE 802.11 devices are capable of transmitting at several different rates. The different rates can use different channel access methods, like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or directs sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and different modulation schemes like binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or
	 types of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Each of these have different tolerances of effects like fading, attenuation and interference from other radio sources. In varying channel conditions,
		using the fastest rate might not be optimal for performance. Rate control algorithms adapt the transmission
		rate dynamically to the changing channel conditions, so the performance of the radio link can be maximized.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, in certain channel conditions if hosts transmitted with 54 mbps, the transmissions would not be received correctly, and the throughput would drop to zero.
		However, transmissions with 6 mbps would be correctly receivable due to the simpler modulation (BPSK instead of 64QAM).
		It is not obvious which rate works the best with what channel conditions. There are algorithms to find the best rate.
	</p>

	<p><b>Rate control algorithms</b></p>

	<p>Some rate control algoithms vary the transmission rate according to packet loss. When too many packets are lost (ie. the ACK for them doesn't arrive) the transmission rate is lowered. When a number of packets are sent without loss, the rate is increased.
	</p>

	<p>INET has different rate control algoritm models, like <tt>ARFRateControl</tt>, <tt>AARFRateControl</tt> and
		<tt>OnoeRateControl</tt>.
	</p>

	<p><b>The network</b></p>

	<p>Hosts are placed on the edge of the playground. During the simulation, they move along the edge of the
		playground with different speed, while <i>Host[0]</i> sends UDP packets to <i>sinkHost</i>. There is an
		obstacle in the middle of the playground. The line of
		transmission intersects the obstacle at certain times, which degrades transmissions.
	</p>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>
		The two hosts are configured to move along the edges of the playground at different speeds, so the distance
		between them varies. Host[0] is configured to saturate the channel with UDP traffic when using the fastest
		mode, 54 mbps. This way the maximum throughput can be measured.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two configurations. In one of them, hosts use no rate control mechanism, and in the other they use
		 Adaptive Auto Rate Fallback (AARF). Results for the two simulation runs can be compared, and see how the
		 use of rate control affects throughput.
	</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>

	<p>Below is an animation showing the hosts going around the obstacle. The transmissions intersect the obstacle during the simulation.
		The path the transmission takes through the obstacle varies in length as the hosts are moving.

		The following charts show the nominal data bitrate and the actual application level throughput for the two configurations 
		(the values are in s and bps).

	<p>
		In the configuration where there is no rate control, the nominal bitrate is constantly 54 mbps. The throughput is around
		24 mbps when the transmissions are not obstructed by the forest. It decreases to zero when the forest gets between the hosts.
		In the other configuraton in which the hosts use rate control, the rate control algorithm varies the rate when transmissions
		go through the obstacle. The rate is switched rapidly, which looks like if there were multiple levels on the graph. 
		Some transmissions can still be received correctly even though they go through the forest, the throughput decreases but at first its
		not zero. There are intervals where it decreases to zero, and the rate is set to the lowest level. Throughput and nominal data rate for the two scenarios can be compared on the following charts.

	<p>This shows that rate control is effective in maximizing the performance of the wireless network, as it increases throughput during
		difficult channel conditions. Throughput is not zero in situations when it would be, if rate control wasn't used.
