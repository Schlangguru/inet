	<h1><center>Errorrate Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>This example analyzes how packet error rate changes as a function of distance in 802.11 wireless models.</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>The network contains 2 hosts. <i>sourceHost</i> sends ping requests to <i>destinationHost</i>.
		The configuration is a parameter study, where the variables are the distance between the hosts and the bitrate.
		The distance runs between 100 and 8000 meters, in 25 meter steps. The bitrate is varied between the following values:
		6, 12, 24, 36 and 54 mbps. This results in about 1500 short simulation runs.</p>

		<p>
			Each simulation runs for 1 second. The ping application in <i>sourceHost</i> sends ping requests with the interval of 1 second.
		</p>

	<p><b>Packet error rate</b></p>

	<p>Since <i>sourceHost</i> just sends one or two ping packet in most of the simulations (they might send more because of retries, if the distance is great enough
		so they don't get an answer), the packet error rate cannot be measured. Instead, it is computed from the bit error rate (BER), which is computed from the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR). </p>
