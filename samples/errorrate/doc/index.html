	<h1><center>Error Rate Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>This example analyzes how packet error rate changes as a function of distance in 802.11 wireless networks, as
		calculated by the error model.</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>The network contains 2 hosts. The <i>sourceHost</i> sends a single UDP packet to <i>destinationHost</i>.
		The configuration is a parameter study, where the variables are the distance between the hosts and the bitrate.
		The distance runs between 10 and 550 meters, in 2 meter steps. The bitrate takes the following values:
		6, 12, 24, 36 and 54 mbps. This results in about 1500 short simulation runs.</p>

	<p>
		The hosts operate in 802.11g, in ad-hoc mode. The transmission power is 10mW. The channel model is free space path loss.
	</p>

	<p><b>Packet error rate</b></p>

	<p>Since <i>sourceHost</i> just sends one UDP packet, the packet error rate (PER) cannot be measured. Instead, it is computed by the error model (<tt>Ieee80211NistErrorModel</tt>) from the bit error rate (BER) of the received packet, which is computed from the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR). </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>

	<p>SNIR is recorded from the simulation runs. From this, PER and throughput are computed by the error model. Throughput is the net throughput, but takes
	bit errors into account. It is equal to the nominal data bitrate unless it is decreased because of bit errors as the distance increases. </p>

	<p>
		SNIR is plotted against distance on the following chart. SNIR is measured at the receiver, and depends on the power of the noise and hte power of the signal. The signal power decreases exponentially
		with distance, but the noise power is uniform everywhere (<tt>IsotropicScalarBackgroundNoise</tt>). Thus SNIR decreases exponentially with
		distance. It is also independent of modulations and coding schemes, so it is the same for all bitrates.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next chart shows how packet error rate decreases with SNIR. After a certain SNIR value, the packet error rate is very small, about 10^-14, which can be taken as 0. Slower bitrates use simpler modulation like binary phase shift keying, which is more tolerant to noise than more complex
		modulations used by faster bitrates, hence the difference on the graph between the different bitrates.
	</p>

	<p>The following chart shows the packet error rate vs distance. Note that the scale is logarithmic. 
		Again, slower bitrates show less packet errors as the distance increases because of the simpler modulation.</p>

	<p>Throughput vs distance is plotted on the next chart. Higher bitrates are more sensitive to increases in distance, as the throughput drops rapidly after a critical distance.
		This critical distance is farther for slower bitrates, and the decrease is not as rapid. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

	<p>Packet error rate increases quickly as the distance approaches the critical point. Slower bitrates are less sensitive to increasing distance, because they use simpler modulation. Faster bitrate modes
		are advantageous in short distances because of the increased throughput, but slower modes work better at longer distances. Furthermode, using rate adaptation, a host can use fast modes
		in short distances and slower modes for larger ones. When the number of lost packets increases and throughput drops, it becomes more
		viable to change to a lower bitrate mode. The rate control algorithm changes to the slower bitrate at around the critical point,
		about where the curves for two adjacent bitrate modes intersect. Note that not all bitrates of 802.11a are simulated in this model,
		the only two adjacent bitrate modes are the 24 and 36 Mbps ones.
