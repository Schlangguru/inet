	<h1><center>Errorrate Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>This example analyzes how packet error rate changes as a function of distance in 802.11 wireless models.</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

	<p>The network contains 2 hosts. The <i>sourceHost</i> sends ping requests to <i>destinationHost</i>.
		The configuration is a parameter study, where the variables are the distance between the hosts and the bitrate.
		The distance runs between 100 and 8000 meters, in 25 meter steps. The bitrate takes the following values:
		6, 12, 24, 36 and 54 mbps. This results in about 1500 short simulation runs.</p>

		<p>
			Each simulation runs for 1 second. The ping application in <i>sourceHost</i> sends ping requests with the interval of 1 second.
		</p>

	<p><b>Packet error rate</b></p>

	<p>Since <i>sourceHost</i> just sends one or two ping packet in most of the simulations (they might send more because of retries, if the distance is great enough
		so they don't get an answer), the packet error rate (PER) cannot be measured. Instead, it is computed from the bit error rate (BER) of the received packets, which is computed from the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR). </p>

	<p><b>Radio</b></p>

	<p>about radio config</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>

	<p>SNIR is recorded from the simulation runs. From this, PER and throughput are computed. Throughput is the effective bitrate, the nominal bitrate decreased becuase of packet errors. </p>
	<p>
		SNIR is plotted against distance on the following chart.
	</p>

	<p>SNIR decreases exponentially with distance, and is the same for all bitrates. SNIR is measured at the receiver, and depends on the power of noise and the power of the signal.
		The noise is uniform everywhere (<tt>IsotropicScalarBackgroundNoise</tt>). The signal decreases exponentially with distance.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next chart shows how packet error rate decreases with SNIR. After a certain SNIR value, the packet error rate is very small, about 10^-14, which can be taken as 0.
		There is difference between the various bitrates. Slower bitrates use simpler modulation like binary phase shift keying, which is more tolerant to noise than more complex
		modulations used by faster bitrates. Note that the zigzags in the graph are double arythmetic anomalies.

	<p>The following chart shows the packet error rate vs distance. Again, slower bitrates show less packet errors as the distance increases because of the simpler modulation.</p>

	<p>Throughput vs distance is plotted on the next chart. Higher bitrates are more sensitive to increases in distance, as the throughput drops rapidly after a critical distance.
		This critical distance is farther for slower bitrates, and the decrease is not as rapid.
